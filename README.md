### Hey there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30px">

I’m [k4sum3i](k4sum3i.dev), a full-stack web developer based in Spain.

I love building complete apps and putting a lot of care into frontend design.
If something sparks my curiosity, chances are I’ll prototype it, refine it, and ship it.

### Tech Stack & Tools
* React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
* VS Code, Figma, Notion

### Projects

I don’t have a favorite project right now, but I’m constantly building and experimenting.

### A Bit About Me:

* I love anime (One Piece is my favorite)
* I go to the gym regularly
* I enjoy building things and learning new tech
* I like listening to music while I code
